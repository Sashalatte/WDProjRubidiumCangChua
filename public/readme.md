### **4. How JS will be incorporated**

JavaScript will be used mainly on the “photobooth” page of the website, which simulates the experience of an actual photobooth. It will control the live camera feed, photo capture process, and countdown timer before each picture. It will also manage the application of filters by changing CSS classes or canvas effects. After editing, JS will automatically arrange the images into a photostrip layout and allow users to download/save it. Additionally, it will also help handle smooth page transitions, flash animations, and ambient background effects to enhance the “real-life” feel of the site.
